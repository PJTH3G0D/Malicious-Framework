/*/ OTHER NOTES 
This is part of the < Malicious Framework >
I will release Malicious once Im done with the GUI. 

So far it has ... 

*- Malicious Webscanner   [ advanced algorithm randomizes and
scans a dork list for vuln sites for SQL Injections 
a list of 10 dorks can produce over 100 searches 
scans for usernames, passwords, credit cards identity information as well..]

Malicious Dashboard *-  RAT with Modern GUI for web shells

Malicious Credit Card Checker - using a combination of guzzle,puppeteer,and stripe  
to mass check credit cards using over 15 sk_keys and counting plus so far 34 donation sites 
we try to add at least two sites weekly to our checkers database 

Malicious Engineer 
Socialbot is the step child to Malicious Engineer, its stripped down to be useable 
across most hosting services due to most hosting services not supporting PHP ^8.0
I've taken alot away from this to make it useable for the regular user 
and make it available for test before I release the Malicious Dashboard GUI.
